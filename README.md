## Dataset description:
The dataset included Employee ID, Name, Age, Gender, Department, Job Role, Overtime Hours, Absenteeism days, Work Environment Score, 
Stress Level, Workplace Accidents, Work Hours per Week, Chronic Illness Smoking Status, BMI, Meatal Health Issues, Job Satisfaction,
Health Insurance Provided, Supervisor Support and Salary

## Dataset Size
2000 rows and 20 columns

## Preliminary State
At the beginning, the data was messy, with missing values, duplicates, formatting inconsistencies, negative numbers, and outliers.

## Technology Used
Power BI for data cleaning and Visualization

## Objective
Identify and fix missing and null values.
•	Remove duplicate entries.

## Key Takeaways
•	The total reported workplace accidents stand at 4,087, indicating a need for stricter safety measures.
•	Job satisfaction stands at 3 out of 5, signaling potential dissatisfaction across departments.
•	Departments with higher accident rates should be examined for workplace hazards and compliance with safety protocols.
•	Supervisor support plays a crucial role—satisfaction is higher with better supervisor involvement but fluctuates, indicating inconsistent managerial effectiveness.
•	Departments with low work environment scores (e.g., Operations, Finance) may require intervention for better working conditions.
•	The absenteeism rate is high at 9.39, which may affect overall productivity
•	Sales and IT departments have the most overworked employees, with overtime figures being significantly high compared to other departments.


## Recommendations
•	Enhancing workplace safety requires conducting regular training programs, enforcing strict safety compliance measures, and reviewing high-risk job roles to minimize accidents and ensure employee well-being.
•	Improving employee satisfaction can be achieved by strengthening supervisor support programs, fostering better communication, and enhancing workplace conditions to create a more engaging and positive work environment.
•	Reducing absenteeism involves identifying the root causes of frequent absences, implementing wellness programs to support employees' physical and mental health, and introducing flexible work policies to promote work-life balance.
•	Balancing workloads is essential to prevent employee burnout, which can be achieved by optimizing task distribution and setting reasonable overtime limits,
